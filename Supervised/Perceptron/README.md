# Perceptron

### Definition:

Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. He proposed a Perceptron learning rule based on the original MCP neuron. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time.

There are two types of Perceptrons: Single layer and Multilayer.

- Single layer - Single layer perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns

- Multilayer - Multilayer perceptrons or feedforward neural networks with two or more layers have the greater processing power

The Perceptron algorithm learns the weights for the input signals in order to draw a linear decision boundary.

This enables you to distinguish between the two linearly separable classes +1 and -1.

### Datasets:

- Penguins

The Penguins Dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman's team. It consists of 344 rows and 7 columns. The three different species of penguins are Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, and Gentoo penguins.
